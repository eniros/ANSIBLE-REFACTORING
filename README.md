# ANSIBLE-REFACTORING
Jenkins CI/CD on a 3-tier application && Ansible Configuration Management Dev and UAT servers using Static Assignments

Ansible Refactoring and Static Assignments (IMPORTS AND ROLES)

In the previous CI-CD Ansibile Jenkins project, I implemented CI/CD and Configuration Managment solution on the Development Servers using Ansible 

In this project, I will be extending the functionality of this architecture and introducing configurations for UAT environment.

STEP 1 - Jenkins Job Enhancement/ Refactoring

Download Copy Artifacts plugin on jenkins. This will help us copy all our artifacts to a specific directory in our Jenkins server
Go to Jenkins web console -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> on Available tab search for Copy Artifact and install this plugin without restarting Jenkins

Make a directory inside the root directory.

On the Jenkins-Ansible server, create a new directory called ````ansible-config-artifact```` by running the command below;

```sudo mkdir /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact```

Change permission of the directory

```sudo chmod -R 0777 /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact```

Create a new Freestyle project and name it save_artifacts.

This project will be triggered by completion of your existing ansible project. Configure it accordingly:

   - Configure the directory where you want to copy your artifacts.
   - create a Build step and choose Copy artifacts from other project
   - Specify ansible as a source project and /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact as a target directory.

We configured the number of build to 2. This is useful because whenever the jenkins pipeline runs, it creates a directory for the artifacts and it takes alot of space. By specifying the number of build, we can choose to keep only 2 of the latest builds and discard the rest.

Test your set up by making some change in README.MD file inside your ansible-config-mgt repository (right inside master/main branch).

If both Jenkins jobs have completed one after another â€“ you shall see your files inside /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory and it will be updated with every commit to your master branch.

Now your Jenkins pipeline is more neat and clean.
